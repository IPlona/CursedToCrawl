Privacy Policy
-------------------------------

### Information you provide by playing the game.
None. The game does not gather any information from playing. 
Notably, the standard Google Play analytics is not counted in this "information". 

### Usage of the information
Can't really use information if you don't gather any.

### Request deletion of data
Again, the game does not collect or store your personal data. 
At most the game saves your high score to your device. That data can be deleted by the user, either by uninstalling the game or deleting the game files from your device.
(Note: The high score data is not sent to any servers or outside to your device.)

### Permissions
The game does not need any permissions for sensitive information, as it does not collect any outside info.
If for some reason the game ask permission to external files or apps, deny them and delete the app. That shouldn't happen in any circumtances, something is wrong if it happens.

### How serious we are with this
Only slightly. Your personal data and information should always be secure and safe, it's important that companies/games/apps are straight forward and clear on how they want to use your information. We value the right to know and transparency. 
But refer to the first section of our privacy policy: The game does not gather any information. 
That's why you might get a sense this privacy policy is written little informaly. Even still it is required to have privacy policy.
Our privacy policy simply is: The game does not collect data.
