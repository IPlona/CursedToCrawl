Privacy Policy
-------------------------------

### Information you provide by playing the game.
The game uses Unity Ads, further reading on the privacy policy for Unity ads check their site (you might want to google this on your own too):
- https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-faq 
- https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy 
- https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy 
- If you are interested in the spesific information they gather: https://docs.unity.com/ads/en/manual/GoogleDataSafety#Data_types

But the game is not programmed to collect any information. Only data collected is by what Unity collects with Unity Ads by default.
Notably, the standard Google Play analytics is not counted in this "information". 

### Usage of the information
The game "Cursed to Crawl" does not itself gather any information, but Unity Ads do and thus they also use this information.
The information is used for mainly advertizing, but also to prevent fraud and keep security. 

### Permissions
When watching an ad, the game will ask Unity Ad spesific permission. Any data Unity gathers with this permission is never seen by the game or developers. 

### How serious is this anyways
Only slightly. Your personal data and information should always be secure and safe, it's important that companies/games/apps are straight forward and clear on how they want to use your information. We value the right to know and transparency. 
But as the game is simple and has implimented the most basic of ad systems, we do not see it to be of harm. Like said, the game itself does not gather any data, to our knowledge, only the ad part gathers data. Thus if you are worried for your information, do not watch the ad. The ad is completely voluntary, and only there in case you missed the point of the whole game.
