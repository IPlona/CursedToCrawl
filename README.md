# CursedToCrawl
Repo for mobile game Cursed to Crawl and it's privacy policy.


Privacy Policy
-------------------------------

### Information you provide by playing the game.
The game uses Unity Ads, further reading on the privacy policy for Unity ads check their site (you might want to google this on your own too):
- https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-faq 
- https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy 
- https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy 

But the game does not collect any information outside what Unity collects by default.
Notably, the standard Google Play analytics is not counted in this "information". 

### Usage of the information
Can't really use information if you don't gather any.

### Permissions
When watching an ad, the game will ask Unity Ad spesific permission. Any data Unity gathers with this permission is never seen by the game or developers. 

### How serious we are with this
Only slightly. Your personal data and information should always be secure and safe, it's important that companies/games/apps are straight forward and clear on how they want to use your information. We value the right to know and transparency. 
But seeing how this is a simple game, which on it's own does not send any date out of the device, the answer should be pretty hammered in by now.  
That's why you might get a sense this privacy policy is written little informaly. Even still it is required to have privacy policy.
Our privacy policy simply is: The game itself does not collect personal data from users, but notably, both Unity and Google Play Store have their own collection systems.
